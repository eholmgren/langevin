Langevin Project
----------------

*Eric Holmgren*

This project is a one dimensional Langevin Dynamics simulator written in Python. To run, execute `python lans.py` in the appropriate directory. System variables such as the tabulated potential, temperature, and timestep can be specified using a flag (e.g. --timestep=0.2).
