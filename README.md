Langevin Project
----------------

*Eric Holmgren*

This project is a one dimensional Langevin Dynamics simulator written in Python. To run, execute `python lans.py` in the appropriate directory. System variables such as the tabulated potential, temperature, and timestep can be specified using a flag (e.g. --timestep=0.2). Default parameters are listed in lans.py. The potential, and the position and velocity as functions of time will be graphed. This data will be saved to an output table.
